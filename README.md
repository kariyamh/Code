General constraints and grading notes

All scripts must be standalone and runnable on an air-gapped system using only packages present in Anaconda 2021_05. Prefer pandas and stdlib.

Each project must accept CLI args for input and output file paths. Hardcoded paths are not acceptable.

Provide a README per project with usage, options, and assumptions.

Each assignment should include expected outputs. The sample zip contains expected_* files for testing. Use them to self-validate.

Time commitment <5 hours/week. Each project is sized to be completed in 2â€“10 hours depending on complexity.

For grading make scripts idempotent: running twice should produce same outputs.
